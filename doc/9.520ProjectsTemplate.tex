\section{Problems Statement}

This is where the content of your paper goes.  Remember to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Limit the main text (without bibliography and appendices) to 12 pages.
\item Include, either in the main text or the appendices, all proofs
  and derivations required to substantiate the results.
\item Include {\em in the main text} enough details, including proof
  details, to convince the reviewers of the submissions' merits.
\item Not include author names (this is done automatically), and to
  the extent possible, avoid directly identifying the authors.  You
  should still include all relevant references, including your own,
  and any other relevant discussion, even if this might allow a
  reviewer to infer the author identities.
\end{itemize}
